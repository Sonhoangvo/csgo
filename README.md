# CSGO match result, points predictor
# Overview
The purpose of this notebook is to predict a CSGO player points or whether they will win, lose or draw a given match based on preprocessed statistical data from previous matches. The prediction model utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Linear Regression, chosen for their ability to handle small datasets with high accuracy. This project demonstrates key steps such as data preprocessing, scaling, visualization, model training, and parameter tuning for best precision

# Feature
Data Preprocessing: Clean raw match data and convert it into a usable format.

Data Visualization: Explore relationships within the dataset using graphs to understand patterns.

Robust Scaler: Scale and normalize the dataset for optimal machine learning performance.

Parameter Optimization: Utilize GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the SVC model.

Match Results Prediction: Predict the likelihood of a win, loss or draw based on match statistics.

Points prediction : Predict the amount of points the player will get when complete a match base on their statistics
