# csgo
# Overview
The purpose of this project is to predict whether a CS:GO team will win or lose a given match based on preprocessed statistical data from previous matches. The prediction model utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVMs), chosen for their ability to handle small datasets with high accuracy. This project demonstrates key steps such as data preprocessing, scaling, visualization, model training, and parameter tuning for best precision
